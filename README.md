A simple lisp in Python implementing the basic S-predicates and functions described by
John McCarthy in his 1960 "Recursive Functions of Symbolic Expressions and Their
Computation by Machine, Part I".

This also includes a simple eval in lisp which gets us many of the features we
need to implement lisp in lisp. A bootstrap, if you will.

Written to be simple, use no modules, be easy to read, & fun to work with.

`/base/` contains the basic implementation. Other implementations should copy this and add to it for a nice base.

`/schemey/` contains additions in the spirit of Scheme.
