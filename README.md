A simple lisp in Python implementing the basic S-predicates and functions described by
John McCarthy in his 1960 "Recursive Functions of Symbolic Expressions and Their
Computation by Machine, Part I".

This also included a simple eval which gets us many of the features we need to
implement lisp in lisp. A boostrap, if you will.

Written to be simple, use no modules, be easy to read, & fun to work with.

`/base/` contains the basic implementation. Other implementations should copy this and add to it for a nice base.

`/schemey/` contains additions in the spirit of Scheme.
